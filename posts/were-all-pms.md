# We're All Project Managers Now

## Intro
The transition to remote work means async takes the foreground. Whether, like me, you've transitioned into a remote, distributed company, or your formerly in-person team has gone "remote" during the pandemic, async communication and processes are rapidly taking over. Its especially important to keep in mind that your newly remote team isn't just "working at home"--they're working at home while homeschooling their kids, or navigating an increasingly restricted community (someone please tell me where I can buy face masks, thanks), or dealing stress, family, health issues--you name it. In these situations, we can no longer assume that everyone is able to commit to the same synchronized working hours.

In this new world, the in-person strategies and tactics we used to manage the development life cycle and reliably deliverable valuable software have fallen away. This creates a set of problems that prevent us from getting stuff done, but luckily there's a solution. Keep reading to learn about the pitfalls of async work and find out how you can combat them by being your own project manager.

## The Dangers of Remote, Async Work

Without things like synchronous, in-person daily standups, or the ability "shoulder tap" your PM, tech lead or teammate, its easy to fall prey to a number of common pitfalls.

* Scope creep on your in-flight work
* Missed deliverables--shipping features with missing or unidentified requirements
* Isolation--lack of collaboration at both the implementation planning stage and in your day-to-day coding

How can we avoid these terrible dangers? How can we ensure that our engineering work stays in-scope and on-time, and that it provides deliverables that meet the goals of the product?

We need YOU to be a project manager! And we need you to do your project management using async, written communication.

## What It Means To Be A Project Manager
Congratulations--you're promoted! Kind of. You're a project manager now! What does it mean to be a project manager?

* First off, you are *not* a product manager--your PM is still the keeper of the roadmap, the decider of prioritization, the communicator to stakeholders and business leaders.
* So, what are your responsibilities?
* Document your work like a project manager
  * Declare the problem space--what does this unit of work solve for?
  * Declare the deliverable--when is this unit of work done?
  * Outline discrete tasks that team members can contribute to or pair with you on
  * Write up background info so team members to help you if you're stuck or contribute to the larger deliverable
  * Don't forget your PM! They're not seated next to you anymore, and maybe they're not even getting a daily update via a synchronous standup. That doesn't mean you have to give into scope creep or get overwhelmed with a set of tasks that you are powerless to say "no" to. When outlining new work, suggest a priority and ask your PM to thumbsup/down it, build this step into the workflow of outlining and launching new work.

In the next section, we'll explain how each of these strategies help us avoid the pitfalls described above and we'll take a look at how we can leverage them on an async, remote team.

## The Problems: Scope Creep + Missed Deliverables
In the past you may have leveraged in-person conversation to raise concerns about scope creep and keep your work on track. On an in-person team, its easier for your product manager or tech lead to have a high-degree of awareness of how your work is going, how long its taking to deliver, what you're stuck on, etc. But when you're working from home, in relative isolation, it becomes your responsibility to closely track the progress of your work against your goal and communicate that progress. In order for your product manager, tech lead or teammates to help you stay on track, you need to be your own project manager.

### The Solution: Write Issues with a Problem Statement + Deliverable
Adopting a simple strategy when you write up or claim an issue or ticket can help you do exactly that.

Make sure that any ticket you work on has both a clearly defined **problem statement** and a clearly defined **deliverable**.

* Combat scope creep by clearly outlining what "done" looks like.
* Combat missed deliverables--if your product manager and/or tech lead signs off on what "done" looks like, you avoid pre-launch surprises like "oh no! We're not ready to launch this feature, I thought it would also do X"

At GitHub, we use GitHub (surprise) to manage our project development life cycle. This means we write GitHub issues to document our work on a given project. My team uses issue templates to ensure that any unit of engineering work comes with a written problem statement and deliverable. In this way, engineers are adopting a project management mindset and using async, written communication to help keep our projects on track.

## The Problem: Isolation

When you're working synchronously and/or in-person, one on one conversations with teammates often suffices to set up a successful pairing session or enables you to get someone up and running on a unit of work. When we're no longer in person, or when your coworker isn't available for live conversations at the same time you are, we can struggle to collaborate. This means that we're more often solving problems alone and delivering work slower than when we had another brain to bounce ideas of off or another set of hands to complete a task in parallel with our own.

Once again, adopting a project management mindset can help us avoid these issues.

### The Solution: Write Issues with Context + Task Items
When you're spec-ing out or claiming a unit of work, put on your project manager hat and make sure that the issue or ticket you're writing has a section on background/context and a section with clearly defined engineering tasks.

* By providing background info and breaking out discrete units of work, you enable and invite collaboration.
* Teammates are able to quickly get up to speed in order to pair.
* Teammates are able to work towards the deliverable in parallel by completing some tasks while you do others

On my team at GitHub, we use an issue template that contains a "Task List" section. The engineer owning the issue is responsible for spec-ing out this task list and linking these items to additional issues with their own clearly stated deliverables. This approach to issue writing is employed asynchronously and enables team members to work in parallel to deliver a larger units of work.

## The Problem: Shifting Priorities
On an in-person team, the product manager has a high-degree of awareness of your day-to-day work. They can use this awareness to keep a tight reign on project priorities. On an in-person, or a synchronous team, its also easy for you as an engineer to raise a red flag to your product manager when new issues or considerations arise, always letting them make the final prioritization call.

When we're working remote, and when engineers take on more responsibility for issue or ticket writing, its easy to loose track of the product roadmap or get confused regarding the priority of new work.

One more project management strategy can help us combat this problem.

### The Solution: Don't Forget Your Product Manager
When you're claiming an issue or ticket, writing a new issue or even triaging a bug report, don't forget your product manager! Just because their not sitting next to you anymore, doesn't mean your alone is organizing your priorities.

Write issues with a clearly defined priority, and communicate asynchronously to your product manager, on that issue or ticket, to ask them to approve or amend that priority.

At GitHub, we label our issues with various priority levels, but we also include a section on issues in which priority is calculated and discussed by looking at the issue's visibility, impact and effort-level. Async communication happens between engineers and product managers on this section of the issue, allowing the team to reliable and accurately determine priority with the help of the product manager.

## Conclusion
Engineers thinking like project managers makes for higher performing teams, whether you're remote and async or not. While we may initially chafe at the additional time spent writing and organizing our work, the strategies outlined here ultimately allow empower teams to deliver high-value work, quickly.

As engineers, we must take on the responsibilities of fighting scope creep, ensuring requirements are met and facilitating collaboration. In this way, we participate as full members of a high-functioning team that is in-sync, capable of moving quickly and solving complex problems, all in time for your next big launch.
